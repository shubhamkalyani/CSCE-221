    * You must use an *Edge List*, not an adjacency list
    * You must implement your own *Disjoint Set* with *path compression*
    * Your implementation must handle **multiple components** building a **forest**.
    * Use the edge list data in */data/RC_2019-02-01_edges.ndjson*
    * In the ndjson file, use *i* and *j* as edge endpoints, and *w* as the edge weight
    * Complete the provided source file *src/lab10.cpp*


## Rubric
* 10pts towards your final/midterm for a working implementation that generates the correct answer on the Reddit dataset.
