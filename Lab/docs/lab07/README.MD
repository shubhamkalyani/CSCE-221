# 221H Lab 7

## DUE DATE
* Friday April 14 prior to lab (2 week).

## Objectives
* Implement your own **heap_sort** that is templated on iterators.  Provide a similar interface as std::sort()
    * Complete the API skeleton in *include/CSCE221H/heap_sort.hpp*
    * Your implementation must be an **in-place** algorithm
    * You can test using the test file in *test/test_heap_sort.hpp*


## Deliverables
* Implement your own **heap_sort** and test it with random data inputs
* Evaluate the performance of your implementation compared to std::sort using in-order, reverse-order, and random-order data
* Performance evaluation should include varying the size of the data being sorted.
* A writeup of your evaluation should be placed below (with plots) 

## Rubric
* 70pts for your overall implementation of **heap_sort** graded on correctness.  
* 30pts for performance evaluation of your **heap_sort** compared with std::sort.
