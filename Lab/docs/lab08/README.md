# 221H Lab 8

## DUE DATE
* Friday April 21 prior to lab (1 week).


## Objectives
* Implement a BFS-based algorithm to compute the number of connected components in the undirected Reddit edge list.   
* Complete the provided source file *src/lab08.cpp*
* For this task, you can ignore the edge weights


## Deliverables
* C++ Implementation of your BFS and connected components algorithm in *src/lab08.cpp*
* You may **optionally** email me privately to confirm your answer for the # of connected components, **at least 24 hours before the due date**

## Rubric
* 50pts for a valid implementation of Breadth-First Search
* 50pts for a valid calculation of the # of components
