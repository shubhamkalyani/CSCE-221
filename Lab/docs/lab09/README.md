# 221H Lab 9

## DUE DATE
* Friday April 28 (1 week).

## Objectives
* Implement your own **Prim's MST** on your own adjacency list data structure.
    * Your adjacency list must be capable of storing an **undirected** graph where vertices are represented by strings.
    * Your implementation must handle **multiple components** building a **forest**.
    * Use the edge list data in */data/RC_2019-02-01_edges.ndjson*
    * In the ndjson file, use *i* and *j* as edge endpoints, and *w* as the edge weight
    * Complete the provided source file *src/lab09.cpp*
    
  
## Deliverables
* Implement your own **Minimum Spanning Tree** on your own weighted adjacency list string graph
* You may **optionally** email me privately to confirm your answer for the MST Forest, **at least 24 hours before the due date**

## Rubric
* 50pts for a valid implementation of Prim's MST Forest
* 50pts for a valid calculation of total MST Forest edge weight
